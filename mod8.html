    <h1>Native Applications with Hello Electron</h1>
    <p>
      Today I made a native desktop application with the program "Hello Electron." A native application or 
      "native app" is an application program that has been developed for use on a particular platform or device.
      Because native apps are written for a specific platform, they can interact with and take advantage of 
      operating system features and other software that is typically installed on that platform.<a href='code/mane.js' target='_blank' >Here</a>
      is the main code behind my app. In a nutshell, it sets up window perimeters and loads the text into said window, it's 
      quite neet actually. My app is a very simple HMTL page with a button and some CSS loaded into it, just testing the waters for now!
      I was also able to use an icon for the app. That was a simple process that involved some file conversion
      and folder/code tweeking; overall I am very pleased with the results of it, and I would recommend that if one was to make 
      a native app, that they too make an icon.
