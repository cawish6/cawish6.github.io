    <h1>While Loops In JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
      A While Loop is a function present in many coding langauages. It's purpose is to run code that is true, repeatedly 
      until there is code that is false, in which case it would stop, thus ending the "loop." For example if we had this:
      
      <img src='images/True.png' width='300px'>
      
      This whileloop would go on forever, as the statement is always true. But, if we had this piece of code:
      
      <img src='images/false.png' width='300px'>
     
      This while loop would never even run at all. This is because the statement is always false.
