    <h1>While Loops In JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
      A While Loop is a function present in many coding langauages. It's purpose is to run code that is true, repeatedly 
      until there is code that is false, in which case it would stop, thus ending the "loop." For example if we had this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src='images/True.png' width='300px'>
    </p>
      <p>
      This While Loop would go on forever, as the statement is always true. But, if we had this piece of code:
        
    </p>
     <img src='images/false.png' width='300px'>
    <p>
     
      This while loop would never even run at all. This is because the statement is always false. 
      
      While loops can also take use of variables and numbers. You can even make counting loops, like the one in my video.

      In fact, the script seen in the video just generated loop in this webpage, just down below!
