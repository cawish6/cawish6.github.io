  <h1>Canvas in HTML</h1>
  <body>
    <p>
    Today, I learned how one is able to use the HTML editor in Chrome to create various colored shapes. This process is 
    called an HTML Canvas, drawing parallels to a real life canvas, in which one is able to create anything within the 
    boundries of a canvas. In HTML I was able to do this by programming boundries and such, this way I could set various
    colors and various parimeters for squares, but there is so much more that the Canvas can do. It basically works 
    by setting an X and Y cordinates, and choosing a color, and voil√†, a neat square. For example, if I set the 
    cordinates to 50,50 and set the color to blue, a 50 by 50 blue square would generate. 
    This is the script that I used to generate a single one of the squares <a href='code/canva.html' target='_blank' ></a>
