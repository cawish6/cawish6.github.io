    Today, I learned how one is able to use the HTML editor in Chrome to create various colored shapes. In HTML I was able to 
    set various colors and various parimeters for squares, but there is so much more that the Canvas can do. It basically works 
    by setting an X and Y cordinates, and choosing a color, and voil√†, a neat square!

      This is the script that I used to generate a single one of the squares<script src='code/canva.html'></script>
