    <h1>Live Coding with Server Game Fun</h1>
    <p>
      Today, I was put into a live coding enviroment with my fellow coders. This was a flat plain enviroment with each
      one of us represented by cubes. We were tasked with first finding ourselves, and then making our cubes the proper
      size. After that we were given the option to upload a profile picture for our cube avatars. However it was not all 
      fun and games, as we were also tasked with some basic coding. <a href='code/mugi.js' target='_blank' >Here</a> is
      the code that we input into the server, the second line was a customizeable hello message, so it varied from person
      to person. This code would then be output a simple message through the server, and could be viewed through the 
      "Inspect" feature in Google Chrome. This experince taught us to work together and not bully each other, 
      as that is black hat hacking, which is very bad. We also had a blast in the process!
