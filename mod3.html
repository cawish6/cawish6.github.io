    <h1>Basic Math in JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
  JavaScript can make great and wonderous epics, but at it's core is the ability to preform basic math functions, such as 
  additon, subtraction, multiplication, and divsion, among other things. For example, if I was to input 8+2 into an 
  interpreter, you get a result of 10. However one could also make use of variables. A variable is a lot like a mask for a value, 
  in the way that they represent a value, without being a value. Here, I'll show you.
